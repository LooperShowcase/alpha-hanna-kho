        The Samsung Notebook 9 Pro takes advantage of a breathtaking display,
        reduced bezels, and dual 1.5W stereo speakers with Thunder Amp to
        increase maximum volume output, while offering a fully immersive
        experience as you create, work, or enjoy. It also features a
        comprehensively redesigned keyboard, and 14 hours of battery life¹, so
        you can get things done faster, better, and wherever. The Samsung
        Notebook 9 Pro runs on a Windows 10 Home operating system, and is built
        for creative-minded professionals who are looking for products to bring
        their ideas to life. And the Active Pen—with more than 4000 levels of
        pressure sensitivity—comes included in the box, and will inspire users
        to write, draw, and create both for work and fun. The Samsung Notebook 9
        Pro is perfect for creators looking for a top-of-the-line PC that
