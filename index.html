      The Samsung Group[3] (or simply Samsung) (Korean: 삼성) is a South Korean
      multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town,
      Seoul, South Korea.[1] It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1]
      most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South
      Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the 8th
      highest global brand value.[4] Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in
      1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group
      diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance,
      securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the
      late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the
      mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's
      death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung
      Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and Joongang Group.
      Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the
      world's largest information technology company, consumer electronics maker
      and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries
      (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and
      Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's
      13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable
      subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life
      insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the
      oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's
      15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).
